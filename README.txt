Displays the total number of posts at the end of each post's content.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a post count to the end of each post's content. It helps you keep track of the number of post views on your site, which is useful for both admins and readers. Once installed and activated, the post count will automatically display without altering your site's appearance or functionality.  If you want to use shortcode instead of auto insert at the end of content, simply enable shortcode from the settings page and place shortcode in your widget or editor.
